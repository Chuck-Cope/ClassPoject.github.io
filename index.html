<h1> This Is My Hobbies Site, Welcome </h1>
<h2> Me! </h2><br>
<!--Some information about me-->

<p> I am Chuck, I'm married, have 1 daughter and 2 dogs.  I am 44 and have lived in Wichita almost all of my life, had 2 years in the 80's that I was in Texas. 
  I have working at Textron Aviation, formally Cessna Aircraft, for 23 years and most of that time was spent in the Quality organization.</p>
    <br><br><h2> Hobbies! </h2><br>
<!--This section is about autocrossing-->
<p>As a child I had a few hobbies, but mainly I built model cars.  As I grew older I transistion to working on real cars and re-built a 1972 Dodge Demon. I found with that hobbie I 
scared to build what I drove, it sat in the garage all the time. I finally sold the Demon and got into my next hobbie, autocross. I joined the <a href="https://www.wichitascca.org/">Wichita Region of the SCCA
  </a>. I used 2 cars for autocross but my favorite was my 1999 Acura Integra. I got pretty good at autocross and won my division in the Wichita region my second year. My third year 
  technology caught up with me and one of the new model cars in my class was very hard to beat, I couldn't beat it without spending some money. Here is a fun <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC2MRvovrNI/"> video</a> of me doing an autocross.

<!--This section is about wakeboarding and wakesurfing-->
<p>Autocross was fun but is was expensive for the little time I actually was able to autocross, maybe 15 minutes of drive time 1 to 2 times a month. On top of that I was the only one to really enjoy it.
I decided to move on to boating, basically taking the boat out and floating all day. With that came water sport, namely wakeboarding. It took me an entire summer to get up on the board, it was a lot of work.
I no longer have any problems getting up and really enjoy it. I did get to where I was able to jump wake to wake but that was getting hard on the knees and I struggle with landings at time. 
Crashing was wearing me out and taking the fun away so now I mostly just have fun on top of the water and am trying to learn tricks that don't involve jumping. I do have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAAgTjxZiO8/">
video</a> of me wakeboarding taken from someone on a tube between me and the boat.
We are getting older so we are transisioning to wakesurfing, it is much slower, 10 to 15 MPH vs 20 to 22 for wakeboarding and takes much less energy to do. Neither of our boats are designed for surfing so we have to 
add weight to the boat by adding fatsacs, bags we pump water into, and a surf wedge that suctions to the side of the boat and creats a wave in the back. You can see pictures on the <a href="Images.html">Pictures</a> page.

<!--Talk about woodworking-->
<p>
  I recently began woodworking, I don't know how in depth I will get but it started with the desire to refinish my basement. I started with a lot of Google and doing a lot of how to research. I bought a jointer, a 
  surface planer, a router, and a router table.  I taught myself how to make strait edges on a board first with the router table then with a jointer. My first project was my bar, you can see it on the <a href="Woodworking.html">My Bar Project</a> 
  page. That was a challange, I made the straight edges with my router table, glued it up, then sufaced it with a jig I made and the router. The surfacing was a lot of work I didn't want to repeat. I then bought the 
  jointer to get my straight edges and a surface planer to get all the boards the same thickness. With the thickness planer all I had to do was sand the seams smooth, they never stay perfect. Pictures can be found on my
  <a href="Images.html">Pictures</a> page.
