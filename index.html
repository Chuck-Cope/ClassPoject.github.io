<h2> Me! </h2><br>
<p> I am Chuck, I'm married, have 1 daughter and 2 dogs.  I am 44 and have lived in Wichita almost all of my life, had 2 years in the 80's that I was in Texas. 
  I have working at Textron Aviation, formally Cessna Aircraft, for 23 years and most of that time was spent in the Quality organization.<p>
    <br><br><h3> Hobbies! </h3><br>
As a child I had a few hobbies, but mainly I built model cars.  As I grew older I transistion to working on real cars and re-built a 1972 Dodge Demon. I found with that hobbie I 
scared to build what I drove, it sat in the garage all the time. I finally sold the Demon and got into my next hobbie, autocross. I joined the <a href="https://www.wichitascca.org/">Wichita Region of the SCCA
  </a>. I used 2 cars for autocross but my favorite was my 1999 Acura Integra.
