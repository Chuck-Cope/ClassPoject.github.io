<!--This section is about autocrossing-->
<p>As a child I had a few hobbies, but mainly I built model cars.  As I grew older I transistion to working on real cars and re-built a 1972 Dodge Demon. I found with that hobbie I 
scared to build what I drove, it sat in the garage all the time. I finally sold the Demon and got into my next hobbie, autocross. I joined the <a href="https://www.wichitascca.org/">Wichita Region of the SCCA
  </a>. I used 2 cars for autocross but my favorite was my 1999 Acura Integra. Here is a fun <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC2MRvovrNI/"> video</a> of me doing an autocross.

<!--This section is about wakeboarding>
<p>Autocross was fun but is was expensive for the little time I actually was able to autocross, maybe 15 minutes of drive time 1 to 2 times a month. On top of that I was the only one to really enjoy it.
I decided to move on to boating, basically taking the boat out and floating all day. With that came water sport, namely wakeboarding. It took me an entire summer to get up on the board, it was a lot of work.
I no longer have any problems getting up and really enjoy it. I did get to where I was able to jump wake to wake but that was getting hard on the knees and I struggle with landings at time. 
Crashing was wearing me out and taking the fun away so now I mostly just have fun on top of the water and am trying to learn tricks that don't involve jumping. I do have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAAgTjxZiO8/">
video</a> of me wakeboarding taken from someone on a tube between me and the boat.
