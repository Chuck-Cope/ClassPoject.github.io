    <h2>How to wakeboard</h2>
<p>
Learning to wakeboard can be very difficult. There are several ways to learn and many things to learn as you go. The first is to get up on the board. This depends on having a good driver.
For the rider, the first steps in the water, assuming you figured out how to get the board on and are holding the rope, is to place the board in front of you. You want your knees bent and the 
rope running over the edge of the board. Your elbows can either fit between your knees or wrap around your knees, which ever is most comfortable.

The driver will then begin to go, as the rope pulls you will fight the boat, you want to try and keep your butt in the water and stay crouched. The boat will pull you out of the water.
When it does you can stand up and your body will decide which way to turn the board, I don't know why, I just know it does.
