            Here are a few links I like or have used. For cars, I like looking at wrecks, who doesn't. The Wrecked Exotics link is to a website 
            that contains pictures of high end wrecked cars. Another page I keep going back to is for a supercharger for my Charger. I really want one but justifying 
            the money it takes to get one is difficult, so far I haven't been able to in my mind.</p><br><p>
            Under the Wood column you will find a couple links having to do with woodworking. The Woodshop is part of MakeICT, a local site for a group that does differnt 
            things such as teaching and perfoming different skills and hobbies. The Woodshop is dedicated to woodworking and is an actual shop full of tools that members can use
            for projects. The router table jointer is a youtube video that was one of many I watch while doing my projects. This one showed me how to you my router table as a
            jointer.</p><br><p>
                            Finally my Wake column, this contains links to site I buy my stuff from.  Evo is where I have bought bindings and wakeboards from. Wakemakers is where my ballest bags 
            came from.
