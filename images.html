    I started out on my main page talking about cars so I thought I better have something to share car related.
    First I'll start with my Dodge Demon, I boutght the car as a shell only and added a drive train and suspension I had from another car.

    I worked a couple months to get it together.  I will be honest, it was what I call a 10 footer which means it looks good from 10 feet away.
    My limited budget didn't allow me do to it right, just get it done enough to not rust.

    I also spent time going off roading, this is my '81 Toyota.

    This is my autocross car, a 1999 Acura Integra GSR.

    I also had a time when I rode motorcycles a lot. This was my 2001 Yamaha R1.

        Today I have a 2013 Dodge Charger, for a short time I had a 2006 Charger Daytona also. The Daytona is the red one.

        Now my wakesurfing, this is new to me and I am just learning.  Here is an image of me then my buddy wakesurfing behind my boat.
        <h5><img src="/ClassPoject.github.io/pictures/Wakesurfing.jpg"alt="Me wakesurfing" > </h5>

        Now finally, the rest of my woodworking.  I did a couple of projects after the bar. 
        I made a beam to go where a wall used to be, it was the easiest way to finish off the ceiling.
        <h5><img src="/ClassPoject.github.io/pictures/Beam.jpg"alt="Ceiling Beam" width="600" height="400"> </h5>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Next I made a ledge that is under my window, this is the TV side of the room.
        <h5><img src="/ClassPoject.github.io/pictures/Ledge.jpg"alt="Window Ledge" width="600" height="400"> </h5>
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Then I made a bar ledge under the bar side of the window. This side hangs over the wall about a foot and half.

        The final product
